// @Reducer
// It's not a property wrapper, it's a macro. This macro extends our structure

// @ObservableState
// Creates some register for this property and saves in this register.Every time someone changes a property. This code goes through this register, looks at where this property was accessed and, accordingly, new values ​​are transferred (How to property wrapper Biding or Observable SwiftUI for example)

// enum Action { a set of signals that we will send. + and - numbers

/// inout means that the State reference will be passed and all changes that will be made in this function will be applied to the object that was passed as a parameter
